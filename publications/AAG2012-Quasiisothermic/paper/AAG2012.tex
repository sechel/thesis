\begin{abstract}
The quality of a quad-mesh depends on the shape of the individual
quadrilaterals. The ideal shape from an architectural point of view is the
planar square or rectangles with fixed aspect ratio. A parameterization that divides a
surface into such shapes is called isothermic, i.e., angle-preserving and
curvature-aligned. Such a parameterization exists only for the special class of
isothermic surfaces. We extend this notion and introduce quasiisothermic
parameterizations for arbitrary triangulated  surfaces.

We describe an algorithm that creates quasiisothermic meshes.
Interestingly many surfaces appearing in architecture are close to
isothermic surfaces, namely those coming from form finding methods and physical
simulation. For those surfaces our method works particularly well and gives a
high quality and robust mesh layout. We show how to optimize such meshes
further to obtain disk packing representations. The quadrilaterals of these
meshes are planar and possess touching incircles.

\section{Introduction}
% TODO: 
% motivation: interesting properties of isothermic surfaces, dealing benefits
% of conformal vs. curvature line parameterization, References???  

A key problem in architectural geometry is to convert surfaces created by form
finding methods, physical simulation, or manual modeling to quadrilateral
meshes, which are preferred for glass-steel structures. There are many 
possible quad-meshes that approximate a given shape and we study those that consist
of principle-curvature-aligned conformal squares (see Fig.~\ref{fig:all_mesh}). 
Not all surface shapes can be approximated by such meshes. A smooth analog of
a surface with this property is called an isothermic surface. These surfaces admit conformal
curvature line parameterizations, i.e., angle-preserving parameterizations
aligned with the principle curvature directions. Their discrete counterpart are 
so-called S-isothermic meshes. These meshes have the additional property that
neighboring quadrilaterals possess touching incircles (see
Fig.~\ref{fig:s_isothermic}).  

The class of isothermic surfaces comprises, for example, constant mean
curvature surfaces. Roofs that act shell-like turn out to have almost constant
mean curvature. These are the kinds of surfaces that initiated our study of
conformal curvature line parameterizations in the architectural context. Both
conformality and alignment with curvature lines are favorable
properties for meshes. 

%A recent trend in free-form architecture is looking for visually pleasing mesh
%structures and cost optimized geometries. Repetitive patterns like circle patterns or
%packings on surfaces have been investigated and used on real buildings. For
%references to research in this direction we refer to the next section.

%\emph{Talk about the functional and the method here}
%It is not in the scope of this paper to find global minimizers $\Phi$ of the
%functional $Q^\alpha$. Instead we propose a method that works well on a
%reasonable class of surfaces. These surfaces are

%Different kinds of parameterizations of triangulated surfaces have been studied
%by many researchers in the field. As in the smooth theory, it is often easier
%to investigate properties of a surface patch in the parameter domain than
%directly on the embedding. 
%The research concerning parameterizations of triangle meshes 
%is driven by a wide
%range of applications in computer graphics, geometry processing, or recently in
%architectural geometry. Special parameterizations adapted from differential
%geometry serve various purposes. Conformal mappings are angle preserving and a
%good candidate for example for texture mapping. Whereas curvature line
%parameterizations capture the geometry of the surface. Parameterizations along
%conjugate directions allow for planar faces.

%novelty benefits advantages 
\newpage
\noindent The contributions of this paper are:\\
\noindent\textbf{Definition of quasiisothermic parameterizations:} 
We propose a definition of quasiisothermic parameterizations of triangle meshes. 
It is based on angles between curvature directions and edges of a triangle mesh.
We define the quasiisothermic modulus that measures how isothermic a 
parameterization is. If this modulus is zero we obtain discrete isothermic 
parameterizations in the sense of our definition.

%For triangle meshes that approximate isothermic surfaces, i.e. surfaces that
%admit conformal curvature line parameterizations, we give an algorithm that
%optimizes the quasiisothermic factor.

%We propose a surface parameterization technique that creates parameterizations
%that are on the one hand conformal and on the other hand capture 
%curvature information. In case of isothermic surfaces we obtain a discrete
%conformal curvature line parameterizations in the sense of discrete differential
%geometry. 

%For non-isothermic surfaces the parameter lines coincide with the curvature
%directions on the boundary.
%
%This leads to a definition of a quality
%measure for the ``isothermicity'' of a parametrization. To construct almost
%isothermic parameterizations, we define special boundary conditions for a
%discrete conformal mapping to the plane. Our scheme uses curvature information
%on the boundary only and creates curvature lines in the interior of the surface
%automatically without explicit integration.

% inherited advantages 
\noindent\textbf{Parameterization Algorithm:}
We give an algorithm that creates quasiisothermic parameterizations based on discrete
conformal maps of triangle meshes to the plane. This approach is build on top 
of the conformal mapping technique of \cite{Springborn:2008:CET}. We
inherit the speed and superior projective mapping properties of their 
parameterizations.

\noindent\textbf{Variational principle for circle packing quad-meshes:}
The obtained parameterizations are used for remeshing and we optimize 
quadrilaterals to have touching incircles by minimizing a novel energy. These
S-isothermic meshes have been studied in discrete differential geometry and
possess some remarkable properties, e.g.,\ minimal S-isothermic surfaces may be
deformed isometrically retaining the same Gau{\ss} map.

%We show how to construct
%this $1$-parameter family of isometric surfaces even if the surface is only
%approximately S-isothermic minimal.

% organization of the paper 
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section~\ref{sec:previouswork}
gives an overview of existing parameterization schemes and their relation to
our approach. We also give reference to the related mathematical literature in
discrete differential geometry. In Section~\ref{sec:parametrization} we define
quasiisothermic parameterizations and a corresponding quality measure. 
In Section~\ref{sec:algorithm} we describe an algorithm to
obtain quasiisothermic parameterizations with small modulus. We describe the 
connection to discrete conformal maps and discuss how we deal with singularities. %XXX
A variational principle to generate S-isothermic meshes is presented in
Section~\ref{sec:s-isothermic}. At the end of the section we show the effect of
our optimization on several examples from different classes of surfaces. In the
final Section~\ref{sec:future} we sum up the results and propose extensions and
enhancements subject to further research.

\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:previouswork}

There has been considerable work on conformal parameterizations as well as on
curvature line parameterizations related to our quasiisothermic scheme. We can 
only give a selection of previous work here.
% general parameterization 
For a general background on mesh parameterization we refer to the surveys by
\cite{Floater:2005:SPA} and \cite{ShefferPR06}.

% conformal 
Our algorithmic approach is based on the discrete conformal equivalence of
triangle meshes introduced in \cite{Springborn:2008:CET} (see
\cite{bobpinspr:discrConformalMaps} for the mathematical background). The
convex functional optimized in Springborn~\emph{et~al.}\ constructs a conformally
equivalent flat mesh for specified boundary conditions and singularities. 
Our work is related to \cite{Sheffer2001}. They aim for conformal parameterizations 
and express this by the additional constraint, that triangle angles have to be close 
to the original ones on the surface. For discrete isothermic parameterizations 
the definitions coincide.
%A different approach based on circle patterns is used by
%\cite{KharevychSSCircle06} to produce conformal mappings from a surface to the
%plane. Global conformal parameterizations for surfaces of arbitrary topology
%were constructed by \cite{GuYauConformal03}.

% curvature line 
Parameterizations aligning with lines of principle curvature were constructed
by\cite{AlliezCDLD03}. Their method involves the integration of curvature vector fields
and does not include an optimization towards conformality. 
Global parameterizations following arbitrary frame fields 
(including in particular principle curvature fields) are constructed
in\cite{KalbererNP:QuadCover07}. They use discrete Hodge decomposition and
harmonic vector fields to obtain a globally consistent parameterization. Their
QuadCover algorithm can deal with surfaces of arbitrary genus and treats
singularities using a suitable branched cover.
Both algorithms cover arbitrary triangulated surfaces and implementations are
highly complex.

% circles on surfaces 
The use of variational principles to enforce desired properties such as planarity of quadrilateral faces has been successfully used in architectural geometry.
\cite{LiuPWYW06} propose an algorithm to optimize a quadrilateral mesh to
become planar and even conical. \cite{PottmannSBSWBW08} use functionals to
approximate freeform surfaces with single curved panels. The energy minimized in
Section~\ref{sec:s-isothermic} is a combination of a new functional with an
energy recently described by \cite{schiftner-2009-cp}. They construct circle
packing triangle meshes that approximate a given surface by minimizing a
combination of energies. Discrete S-isothermic minimal surfaces are defined in
terms of their Gau{\ss} map in \cite{BobHofSpr06}. This Gau{\ss} map is a Koebe
polyhedron with edges tangent to a sphere. These Koebe polyhedra also occur in
the study of edge offset meshes by \cite{pottmann-2007-pm}, which again use a
variational approach to obtain support structures. Another parametrization
technique creating quad-dominant meshes guided by conjugate parameter
directions is given by \cite{zadravec-2010-vf}. Their algorithm includes a level
set approach to circumvent the integration of a vector field.

The notion of discrete S-isothermic meshes was introduced in the mathematical
context by \cite{BobPin:DiscSurfIntSys:1996} as a special class of quad meshes.
The mathematical theory of these meshes has since then been an active field of
research in discrete differential geometry. A good overview of the recent
development and literature can be found in the book~\cite{ddg-book}. 
%The treatment of minimal surfaces and their associated family of isometric surfaces
%can be found in~\cite{BobHofSpr06}. 
%An algorithm to construct triangulated
%minimal surfaces with given boundary conditions is defined in~\cite{MR1246481}.

\section{Discrete Quasiisothermic Parameterization}
\label{sec:parametrization}

In this section we introduce the notion of quasiisothermic parameterizations and the
corresponding quality measure.

\subsection{Discrete Parameterizations}
Let $M=(V,E,F)$ be a triangle mesh. The elements of $V$ are the vertices of the
mesh denoted by simple indices $i\in V$. Edges are denoted by double
indices $\mathrm{\it{ij}}\in E$, and faces are denoted $\mathrm{\it{ijk}}\in F$. A triangulated surface is
a map $S:V\to \mathbb R^3$, $i \mapsto (x_i, y_i, z_i)$.
We call a map $\Phi: V \to \mathbb R^2$, $i \mapsto (u_i,v_i)$ a \emph{discrete
parameterization} of the surface $S$. We only consider orientable surfaces and
parameterizations that preserve the orientation of the triangles with respect to
the canonical orientation of $\mathbb R^2$. 

The next definition connects arbitrary parameterizations with certain directions
tangent to the surface $S$, e.g., curvature directions. Such a direction is encoded as 
an angle per edge. 
%XXX: Ueberleitung; discrete $\alpha$-parameterization? 
% definition parameterization with \alpha
\begin{definition}
Let $\alpha : E \to ]-\frac{\pi}{2},\frac{\pi}{2}]$, $\mathrm{\it{ij}} \mapsto \alpha_{\mathrm{\it{ij}}}$
be a map that assigns an angle to each edge. A discrete parameterization 
$\Phi: V\to \mathbb R^2$, $i \mapsto (u_i,v_i)$ is called a \emph{discrete
parameterization with $\alpha$} if
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:isothermic}
\tan \alpha_{\mathrm{\it{ij}}} = \frac{u_i - u_j}{v_i - v_j}
\end{equation}
for all edges of the mesh.
\end{definition}
In other words, in a parameterization with $\alpha$ the image of an edge $\mathrm{\it{ij}}\in
E$ under the map $\Phi$ encloses the prescribed angle $\alpha_{\mathrm{\it{ij}}}$ with the
$v$-axis of the parameter space. One could equally use the $u$-axis here.

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
\input{../figures/isothermic.pdf_t}
\caption{A discrete isothermic parameterization. Angles between triangle edges 
and a curvature direction family are preserved by the map.}
\label{fig:parameterization}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Quasiisothermic Parameterizations}
Our main example of a parameterization with an angle function $\alpha$ comes
from $\alpha$ defined by the curvature directions of a surface $S:V\to
\mathbb R^3$ (see Fig.~\ref{fig:parameterization}). For a triangulated surface 
curvature directions and magnitudes can be calculated and assigned to edges. This 
is usually done by averaging curvature information over neighborhoods of points 
on the surface \cite{CohMor03}. A discrete parameterization 
with angle function $\alpha$ stemming from the curvature direction field is then called a
\emph{discrete isothermic parameterization}. Indeed, the latter is just a
curvature line parameterization. In our case the curvature directions
are mapped to the coordinate directions in the $(u,v)$-plane. The map can be
treated as conformal: Angles between edges and curvature directions are 
preserved.

Generic surfaces do not allow for isothermic parameters (those admitting
isothermic parameterizations are called isothermic surfaces). Therefore we do
not expect a parameterization with given $\alpha$ to exist in general. To be
able to deal with arbitrary surfaces we introduce the notion of discrete
quasiisothermic parameterization. The idea is to obtain a parameterization with
angles $\tilde\alpha$ as close to the curvature directions $\alpha$ as possible.
Let
\begin{equation}
Q^\alpha(\mathrm{\it{ij}})=\left|\alpha(\mathrm{\it{ij}}) - \tilde\alpha(\mathrm{\it{ij}})\right|
\label{eq:quasiisothermicity}
\end{equation}
where $\tilde\alpha(\mathrm{\it{ij}})$ is angle the between the $v$-axis and the edge $\mathrm{\it{ij}}$ in 
parameter space.
\begin{definition}
We call a discrete parameterization $\Phi$ with angle function $\alpha$ 
\emph{quasiisothermic} with modulus $Q\in \mathbb R_+$ if
\begin{equation}
Q^\alpha(\mathrm{\it{ij}}) \leq Q
\end{equation}
for all edges $\mathrm{\it{ij}}\in E$.
\end{definition}
The motivation for this measure of quasiisothermicity is the following: If $Q$ is small
the directions of principle curvature on the surface are almost tangent to the parameter 
lines of the parameterization. For a modulus of zero we have an in a sense angle 
preserving map where edges enclose the same angles with the coordinate axes in 
parameter space as with curvature directions on the surface. We will now 
create parameterizations that have small $Q$.

%\subsection{Compatibility and Existence}
%%existance of a solution
%The question remains whether for any given function $\alpha$ there is a map
%$\Phi$ that satisfies Equation~\ref{eq:isothermic}. If one considers only one
%triangle the answer is of course yes. Given angles for three edges, the
%corresponding triangle in parameter space is determined up to scale and
%rotation by $\pi$ (see Fig.~\ref{fig:conditions} left).
%\begin{figure}
%\centering
%\input{../figures/triangle_angles.pdf_t}
%\input{../figures/sin_condition.pdf_t}
%\caption{The angles $\alpha$ at triangle edges determine the triangle up to
%scale and rotation by $\pi$. The triangle angles $\beta$ at an edge star
%of a parameterization need to satisfy the
%$\sin$-condition~(\ref{eq:sin-condition}).}
%\label{fig:conditions}
%\end{figure}
%If we take all triangles incident to one vertex into account we obtain a
%compatibility condition for $\alpha$. For an edge star to close up in parameter
%space the edge lengths of adjacent triangles need to agree. We use the
%well-known $\sin$-condition \cite{Sheffer2001} to formulate this using triangle
%angles. For a triangle $ijk\in F$ the angle function $\alpha$ determines the
%angles of this triangle in the $u,v$-plane. We denote the angle at vertex 
%$i\in V$ as $\beta^i_{jk}$, and at vertices $j$
%and $k$ as $\beta^j_{ki}$ and $\beta^k_{ij}$ respectively.
%For all interior vertices $i\in V_I$ the $\sin$-condition reads
%\begin{equation}
%\frac{\prod_{ijk\in F}\sin \beta^j_{ki}}{\prod_{ijk\in F}\sin \beta^k_{ij}}=1
%\label{eq:sin-condition}
%\end{equation}
%There are a lot of angle functions $\alpha$ that satisfy this condition. Namely
%any parameterization of $M$ gives rise to such a function. Here the resuling
%directions on the surface don't need to be principle curvature directions. 


%This observations leads to a straightforward definition of quasiisothermic
%parameterizations. For a given surface and an arbitrary parameterization we can
%calculate the angles $\alpha$ between edges and a coordinate axis in parameter
%space. For a given curvature direction field and surface orientation we can
%alsocalculate a function $\tilde\alpha$ for edges on the surface. The function
%\begin{eqnarray*}
%Q^\alpha(ij) &:=& \left| \alpha_{ij}-\tilde{\alpha}_{ij} \right|
%\end{eqnarray*}
%expresses how good the parametrization matches the prescribed angle constraints
%at a single edge $ij\in E$.
%By summing over all edges of the input mesh we obtain a measure to determine
%thequasiisothermicity of a parametrization:
%\begin{equation}
%\label{eq:quasiisothermicity}
%Q^\alpha(\Phi) = \frac{1}{\#E}\sum_{ij \in E} \left|
%\alpha_{ij}-\tilde{\alpha}_{ij} \right|.
%\end{equation}
%
%\emph{\underline{We have to revise this definition.}}

%We start out with a triangle mesh $M=(V,E,F)$ with disk topology and
%vertices~$V$, edges~$E$, and faces~$F$. Because of the simple topology the mesh
%may be oriented consistently by choosing normals for the faces or ordering the
%vertices of the triangles. We call a map $\Phi: V \to \mathbb R^2$, $v \mapsto
%\Phi(v_i) = (x_i,y_i)$ preserving the orientation a \emph{discrete
%parameterization} of the surface $M$. This map naturally extends to edges and
%faces of the mesh.
%
%We recall the definition of discrete conformal equivalence of triangle meshes
%given by Springborn \emph{et al.}~\cite{Springborn:2008:CET}. It is stated in
%terms of edge lengths of the surface edges and corresponding parameter edges in
%the $xy$-plane.
%
%\begin{definition} 
%  A discrete parameterization~$\Phi$ is \emph{conformal} if there exist a
% function $u:V \to \mathbb{R}$, $v_i \mapsto u_i := u(v_i)$ such that the
%following condition for
% the edge lengths $l$ and $\tilde{l}$ of the edges $e=(v_i,v_j)$ and $\Phi(e)$
%holds
%\begin{eqnarray}
%  \label{eq:discrete_conformal} 
%  \tilde{l}=e^{(u_i+u_j)/2}l.
%\end{eqnarray}
%\end{definition}
%
%Springborn \emph{et al.}~\cite{Springborn:2008:CET} show how to find a
%function~$u$ for a given triangle mesh by minimizing a convex functional.
%
%To construct parameterizations aligning with given directions, in particular
%principle curvature directions, we consider a function $\alpha:E\to
%[-\frac{\pi}{2},\frac{\pi}{2}[$ on the edges of the surface. We call a
%parameterization~$\Phi$ an \emph{$\alpha$-parameterization} if
%for any $e=(v_i,v_j)\in E$
%\begin{eqnarray}
%  \label{eq:curvature_lines} 
%  \tan \alpha(e) = \frac{x_i - x_j}{y_i - y_j}
%\end{eqnarray} 
%with $\Phi(v_i) = (x_i,y_i)$ and $\Phi(v_j) = (x_j,y_j)$, i.e.,\ the angle
%between the edges $\Phi(e)$ in the plane and the $y$-axis is exactly
%$\alpha(e)$. Moreover, if the function $\alpha$ is defined by principle
%curvature directions we call the corresponding $\alpha$-parameterization a
%\emph{discrete curvature line parameterization}. Summing up the above
%definitions we obtain the following
%
%\begin{definition}
%  \label{def:disoparam} 
% A parameterization $\Phi$ is a \emph{discrete isothermic parameterization} if
%it is a discrete conformal curvature line parameterization.
%\end{definition}
%
%As not all surfaces admit a conformal curvature line parameterization we propose
%the following quality measure for a discrete conformal parametrization $\Phi$
%and an angle function $\alpha$. For an edge $e_i$ let $\alpha_i$ be the
%prescribed angle from the curvature vector field. Let $\tilde{\alpha}_i$ be the
%angle between the edge $\Phi(e)$ and the $y$-axis in the parameter domain. Then
%\begin{eqnarray*}
%Q^\alpha(e) &:=& \left| \alpha_i-\tilde{\alpha}_i \right|
%\end{eqnarray*}
%expresses how good the parametrization matches the prescribed angle constraints
%at a single edge.
%By summing over all edges of the input mesh we obtain a measure to determine the
%isothermicity of a parametrization:
%\begin{equation}
%\label{eq:isothermicity}
%Q^\alpha(\Phi) = \frac{1}{\#E}\sum_{e_i \in E} \left| \alpha_i-\tilde{\alpha}_i%\right|.
%\end{equation}
%Surely, the functional depends on the quality of the curvature directions
%encoded by $\alpha$. But once the angle function $\alpha$ is fixed, we obtain a
%functional on the space of conformal parameterizations. We call a discrete conformal
%minimizer of this functional an \emph{as-isothermic-as-possible parameterization}.
%The parameters are the data needed to uniquely determine a discrete conformal
%parametrization, e.g., the boundary angles and the singularities with associated
%curvatures.

\section{Minimization of the Functional}
\label{sec:algorithm}

In this section the surface $M$ is a triangulated surface with one boundary
component. We will now construct a function $\Phi$ that
has zero approximation error $Q^\alpha$ at boundary edges and is a discrete
conformal map in the sense of \cite{Springborn:2008:CET} in the interior of the
surface. We argue under which circumstances this leads to nice
behaviour in the interior. We start by briefly introducing discrete conformal
maps and the boundary conditions we need for our purposes.

\subsection{Discrete Conformal Maps}

We recall the definition by Springborn~\emph{et al.} of discrete conformal 
maps via conformal equivalence of triangle meshes. It is stated in terms of
lengths of the surface edges and corresponding parameter edges in the 
$(u,v)$-plane.
\begin{definition} 
  A discrete parameterization~$\Phi$ is \emph{conformal} if there exists a
function $\mu:V \to \mathbb{R}$, $i \mapsto \mu_i$ such that the following
condition for the edge lengths $l_{\mathrm{\it{ij}}}$ on the surface and
$\tilde{l}_{\mathrm{\it{ij}}}=\Vert\Phi(i)-\Phi(j)\Vert$ in parameter space holds
\begin{eqnarray}
  \label{eq:discrete_conformal} 
  \tilde{l}_{\mathrm{\it{ij}}}=\mu_i\mu_j l_{\mathrm{\it{ij}}}.
\end{eqnarray}
\end{definition}
%XXX (u,v)-plane vs. function u
For a given triangle mesh there is a unique solution $\mu$ that retains the 
boundary edge lengths. Another unique solution can be obtained by fixing 
the angles between consecutive boundary edges. These angles have to be 
chosen consistently obeying the Gau\ss-Bonnet relation 
(see Sec.~\ref{sub:boundary}).

The function~$\mu$ for a given triangle mesh can be found as the minimizer 
of a convex functional. Thus its computation is efficient. The resulting 
parameterization is created by a breadth-first layout that enumerates 
all triangles and assigns texture coordinates. In addition to boundary angles 
one can ask for solutions that contain special interior vertices where the
 sum of triangle angles is not equal to $2\pi$ (see Fig.~\ref{fig:teaser}). 
These so-called cone points will be inserted at singularities of the 
parameterization.

%
%\noindent {\bf Idea.} If we specify appropriate conditions on the
%boundary arising from one of the principle curvature directions and place
%singularities with suitable curvatures, we can construct a conformal
%parameterization that aligns with these principle curvature directions. For
%isothermic surfaces this will produce a discrete isothermic parameterization for
%the entire surface in the sense of the stated functional, i.e., $Q^\alpha(\Phi)$
%will be small. 

\subsection{Curvature Boundary Conditions}
\label{sub:boundary}

\begin{figure}[b]
\centering 
\input{../figures/boundary_conditions2_horizontal.pdf_t}
\caption{Curvature boundary conditions: In parameter space the interior angle 
$\theta_j$ at the vertex~$\Phi(j)$ has to be chosen such that curvature 
directions given by angles $\alpha_{\mathrm{\it{ij}}}$ and $\alpha_{\mathrm{\it{jk}}}$ align with the 
$v$-axis. This choice is unique up to addition
of $k \pi$. The above pictures show two possible layouts in the parameter
plane depending on the interior angle sum on the surface.}
\label{fig:boundary_angles}
\end{figure}

%Let $Y$ be a map that assigns a direction $Y_i$ to every edge~$e_i$ of the
%triangulation. This information can be transformed into an angle map $\alpha:
%E\to [-\frac{\pi}{2},\frac{\pi}{2}[$ of signed angles between the edges $e_i \in
%E$ and the directions $Y_i$ as used in the previous section. 

Let $\alpha:E\to ]-\frac{\pi}{2},\frac{\pi}{2}]$ be an angle function derived
from numerical curvature directions and the given surface orientation. 
Let $\mathrm{\it{ij}}\in E$ and $jk\in E$ be two consecutive boundary edges with common
vertex $j$ and let $\tilde\theta_j$ be the sum of interior triangle angles on
the surface at this vertex.  The direction of the edge $\Phi(\mathrm{\it{ij}})$ (resp.\
$\Phi(\mathrm{\it{jk}})$) is determined by the angle $\alpha_{\mathrm{\it{ij}}}$ 
(resp. $\alpha_{\mathrm{\it{jk}}}$),
since the curvature directions encoded by the $\alpha$'s should align with the
$v$-axis. The orientation of the surface (resp.\ the boundary edges) defines
the angle $\theta_j$ between the edges $\Phi(\mathrm{\it{ij}})$ and $\Phi(\mathrm{\it{jk}})$ up to
addition of $k \pi$ (see Fig.~\ref{fig:boundary_angles}). To make the angle
unique we require that the difference between the original surface angle
$\tilde\theta_j$ and the angle in the parameter plane $\theta_j$ is as small
as possible, i.e.,\ choose $k>0$ as small as possible such that 
\[
|\underbrace{\angle(\Phi(\mathrm{\it{ij}}),\Phi(\mathrm{\it{jk}}))+ k \pi}_{\theta_j} - \tilde\theta_j| \le \pi/2.
\]
% There are four possible choices for $\theta_j$ with given $\alpha_{ij}$
% and $\alpha_{jk}$. Namely the two angles enclosed by the corresponding two lines 
% in the plane and those angles plus $\pi$. We fix the orientation of the boundary 
% such that the surface is on the left side. This reduces the number of possible 
% boundry angles to two, namely 
% $\gamma$ and $\gamma + \pi$.
% To remove the remaining ambiguity we assume that curvature
% directions do not turn more than $\pi/2$ per boundary vertex. Therefore we
% require $\left|\tilde\theta_j -\theta_j\right| \leq \frac{\pi}{2}$ which determines
% $\theta_j$ uniquely and induces a consistent orientation of curvature
% directions along boundary. 
See Figure~\ref{fig:boundary_angles} for an
illustration of the alignment in the parameter plane. The angles $\theta_j$ at
boundary vertices serve as boundary conditions for the discrete conformal
parameterization. A conformal parameterization with these boundary conditions
will then have perfect alignment of curvature directions at the boundary.

\subsection{Singularities}
\label{sub:singularities}
%gauss bonnet 
%After calculating the boundary angles, we need to introduce some cone
%singularities in the interior of the surface to satisfy the discrete
%Gau{\ss}-Bonnet Theorem. 
There exists an analog of the smooth Gau{\ss}-Bonnet theorem
for discrete surfaces that relates the Gaussian and the boundary curvature to
the Euler characteristic. During parameterization we construct a metric that is
flat everywhere except for cone singularities where positive or negative
curvatures are introduced. For the purpose of curvature line parameterizations
we can only have cone points with discrete curvatures of $\pi$, $0$, or $-k\pi$
at singularities of the curvature direction field. The Gaussian curvature
$\kappa_i$ at interior vertices~$i\in V_I$ is the angle defect, i.e., $\kappa_i =
2\pi-\theta_i$, where $\theta_i$ is the sum of the angles at the vertex~$i$.
For a boundary vertex $j\in V_B$ the corresponding geodesic curvature is defined by
$\kappa^g_j = \pi-\theta_j$. So if we split the vertex set $V = V_B \cup V_I$ into
boundary vertices $V_B$ and interior vertices $V_I$ the discrete
Gau{\ss}-Bonnet theorem becomes:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:gauss-bonnet} \sum_{i\in {V_I}}\kappa_i + \sum_{j\in
  V_B}\kappa^g_j = 2\pi \chi,
\end{equation} 
where $\chi$ is the Euler characteristic of the surface ($\chi = 1$ for disks).
Since all curvature directions at boundary edges in parameter space become parallel, the
boundary curvature adds up to a multiple of $\pi$. If this sum happens to
differ from $2\pi$, there must be singularities in the curvature field and we
have to compensate the deficit at interior vertices to satisfy
Equation~(\ref{eq:gauss-bonnet}). In Figure~\ref{fig:dach01_directions} the
boundary curvature sum of the domain is $4\pi$. So by inspection of the curvature field in the 
interor of the surface we picked two singularities each of curvature $-\pi$ to satisfy the 
Gau{\ss}-Bonnet equation. They correspond to cone points with angle $3\pi$ in the 
parameterization.

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{../images/dach_example01_directions.png}
\caption{Parameterization of the \textsc{Roof} model. The discrete 
curvature lines approximate curvature directions with high quality. See 
Section~\ref{sub:examples_quality} for a discussion.}
\label{fig:dach01_directions}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Implementation}
\label{sub:parameterization}

The algorithm to compute a quasiisothermic parameterization with vanishing modulus at the 
boundary of the domain is the following:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Generate curvature directions and compute $\alpha$ at the boundary
\item Calculate boundary angles $\theta$ and pick singularities
\item Compute conformal parameterization with given $\theta$s
\item Perform remeshing
\item Remove cone point cuts 
\end{enumerate}

\noindent To estimate principle curvature fields we use the method of Cohen-Steiner and
Morvan~\cite{CohMor03}, where the curvature tensor is averaged over a disk of a
given radius centered at edge midpoints. Together with a fixed orientation
of the surface this defines the angle function
$\alpha$. 

We deduce the angles $\theta$ for the boundary vertices as described in
Section~\ref{sub:boundary}. These angles are the boundary curvatures we plug
into the algorithm of Springborn \emph{et al.}\ to obtain a conformal
parameterization. If necessary, we pick singularities for the curvature field at vertices
and prescribe corresponding cone angles by inspection of the curvature direction
field on the interior of the surface. A consistent singularity choice can
easily be checked using Equation~(\ref{eq:gauss-bonnet}). By construction we 
can only process curvature fields with isolated singularities.

We layout the new edges in the parameter plane such that an arbitrary 
boundary edge $\Phi(\mathrm{\it{ij}})$ intersects the $v$-axis in the desired angle 
$\alpha_{\mathrm{\it{ij}}}$. By construction
the intersection angles coincide with the prescribed $\alpha$'s for all
boundary edges. 
The domain of parameterization can contain singularities, which are
modeled as cone points with prescribed curvature. Therefore we have to 
cut along paths from the cone points to the boundary of the mesh. 
The layout overlaps if singularities with negative curvature are used. 
To create seamless parameter lines we use the rectification approach 
described in~\cite{Springborn:2008:CET}.

Finally, we create a new mesh based on a regular $(u,v)$-grid in $\mathbb R^2$. 
The remeshing process is carried out as a subdivision step followed by some cleanup
and regluing: We use the projective interpolation in the texture domain to 
increase the quality of the result. Previously cut paths from singularities to the 
boundary are sewed up to obtain the final remesh.

\subsection{Examples and Quality}
\label{sub:examples_quality}
\begin{figure}

\caption{The quality of the parameterization is measured in radians per
edge of the underlying triangulation. The checkerboard texture indicates the parameter
lines of the map. Small (red and yellow) beads represent good curvature direction quality, big
beads (green and blue) represent high deviation. The color of the histogram
corresponds to the color of the beads. Note that the mean error of the \textsc{Roof} 
surface (top) is half the error of the \textsc{Dome}. See also Table~\ref{tab:quality} 
for detailed quality measures of the other surfaces.}
\label{fig:quality}
\end{figure}
With the quasiisothermic modulus~$Q^\alpha$ on edges introduced in
Equation~(\ref{eq:quasiisothermicity}) we are now able to measure the 
quality of our parameterizations. 
%We will however 
%not use the curvature weigths $(\kappa_1-\kappa_2)^2$ for our quality analysis here.
%Instead we use the unweighted angle differences $\left|\alpha(ij)-\tilde\alpha(ij)\right|$.

\newpage
There are two kinds of examples to consider: The first class of meshes stems from
smooth surfaces that admit conformal curvature line parameterizations, i.e.,
triangulations approximating isothermic surfaces. The second class consists of
arbitrary non-isothermic surfaces. For almost isothermic surfaces we expect
our parameterization to reconstruct the isothermic coordinates up to numerical
precision and hence $Q^\alpha$ to be reasonably small. For non-isothermic
surfaces we achieve the correct directions on the boundary but lack accuracy in
the interior. In Table~\ref{tab:quality} we summarize the numerical results
obtained from the surfaces of Figure~\ref{fig:all_mesh}.

\bigskip
\noindent \textbf{Isothermic surfaces.} The class of smooth isothermic
surfaces contains surfaces of constant mean curvature, surfaces of revolution,
and conic sections.  We use the \textsc{Minimal} example as an instance of an 
isothermic surface with mean curvature zero (Figure~\ref{fig:all_mesh}b). 
%It was created using the software JavaView~\cite{javaview} and is a minimizer of the Dirichlet
%energy introduced in~\cite{MR1246481}. 
As expected this surface exhibits the highest curvature line quality of all tested 
meshes. The error however cannot vanish completely since the surface's curvature 
field contains singularities. In the vicinity of these points the numerical curvature 
directions contain significant amounts of noise.

\bigskip
\noindent \textbf{Non-isothermic surfaces.} Non-isothermic surfaces are
surfaces that do not admit a parameterization with conformal curvature lines. We
investigate
the properties of surfaces (a), (c), and (d) displayed in
Figure~\ref{fig:all_mesh}.

\begin{table}[b]
\centering
\begin{tabular*}{0.7\linewidth}{l|l|l|l|l|l}
 & $\#E$ & $\#\partial E$ & $Q^\alpha_{\mathrm{mean}}$ & $Q^\alpha_{\mathrm{max}}$ &
$Q^\alpha_{\mathrm{\sigma}}$ \\ \hline

\textsc{Teaser} & 17550 & 1000 & 0.057 & 1.20 & 0.066\\
\textsc{Roof} & 3766 & 470 & 0.051 & 0.610 & 0.059 \\

\end{tabular*}  
\caption{The curvature line approximation quality of the examples. $\#\partial
E$ are the number of boundary edges. $Q^\alpha_{\mathrm{\sigma}}$ is the standard
deviation of $Q^\alpha$.}
\label{tab:quality}
\end{table}

The \textsc{Teaser} surface was created as a minimizer of a spring functional
fixing the boundary and modelling interior edges as springs of rest length
zero. It is not far away from a minimal surface with the same boundary. The
curvature
line pattern however differs substantially as it contains singularities whereas
the minimal surface with this boundary curve does not. The quality of the
curvature line pattern is also very high. The mean angle error of the numerical
directions is $3.2$ degrees. Note that the deviation $Q_\sigma$ from the mean
value is also very low. For this surface the coordinates generated by our
algorithm are a globally good approximation to conformal curvature lines.

A quality plot of the \textsc{Roof} surface (Figures~\ref{fig:all_mesh}d and
\ref{fig:dach01_directions}) is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:quality}. Surprisingly, 
the quality of the curvature lines is as high as in the \textsc{Teaser} or the 
\textsc{Minimal} case. This suggests that a slight variation of the surface 
yields an isothermic surface. See also Figure~\ref{fig:dach01_directions} for 
a visual impression of the quality of the curvature lines.

\newpage
The \textsc{Dome} model (Figure~\ref{fig:all_mesh}c) is created from a NURBS
surface. The quality plot (Figure~\ref{fig:quality}) reveals
areas of high angle deviation especially around the singularities. 
%Here we have a mean error of $7.6$ degrees and a deviation of $9.0$ degrees. 
Other areas, in particular those near the boundary, are of high curvature line quality. 
The distance to the nearest isothermic surface is expected to be larger than in the
previous examples. More evidence for this is given in
Section~\ref{sec:s-isothermic}.

\bigskip
\noindent\textbf{Discussion.}
Our parameterization scheme works well for surfaces that are not too far away
from surfaces that possess isothermic coordinates. In the case of surfaces
stemming from minimal or constant mean curvature surfaces we get almost perfect
approximation quality of curvature lines. These are surfaces that are
particularly interesting when designing beam layouts for roof structures that
where form-found. For
other surfaces the parameterization is conformal and the parameter line pattern
captures the combinatorics of the curvature line pattern while approximating
the curvature line geometry.
There are of course surfaces for which our method is not applicable.
If the boundary is too short compared to the overall size of the surface we 
cannot expect the solution to follow curvature lines as the distance to the boundary 
increases.

\section{Discrete S-isothermic Surfaces}
\label{sec:s-isothermic}

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{../images/all_circles.png}
\caption{S-isothermic meshes created from the models presented in
Figure~\ref{fig:all_mesh}.
The inner quadrilaterals are optimized towards touching incircles. A series of
touching circles in a row can be interpreted as discrete curvature line.}
\label{fig:s_isothermic}
\end{figure}

Starting with a quasiisothermically parameterized mesh with low modulus 
we now aim to create discrete S-isothermic surfaces that
stay in the vicinity of the input surface. S-isothermic surfaces were
introduced by \cite{BobPin:DiscSurfIntSys:1996}: A quadrilateral mesh
is \mbox{\emph{S-isothermic}} if (i) all the quadrilaterals are planar, (ii)
all faces have incircles, and (iii) the incircles of adjacent quadrilaterals
touch.
Figure~\ref{fig:s_isothermic} displays S-isothermic surfaces derived from our
parametrizations shown in Figure~\ref{fig:all_mesh}.

\subsection{Variational Principle}

\begin{figure}[t]
\input{../figures/e_touching_circles.pdf_t}
\centering
\caption{Labels for the touching-circles-functional at an edge. The circles touch 
if the ratio $\cot\left(\beta^i/2\right)/\cot\left(\beta^j/2\right)$ is equal on both sides of the edge.}
\label{fig:functional}
\end{figure}

In this section we introduce an energy whose minimizers are S-isothermic
surfaces. We denote quadilaterals by $ijkm\in F$ where the indices are in 
cyclic order.
The S-isothermic energy $E_S$ consists of three parts:
\begin{equation}
  E_S := 
  \lambda_1 E_{\mathrm{planar}} + 
  \lambda_2 E_{\mathrm{incircle}} + 
  \lambda_3 E_{\mathrm{touch}}
\end{equation}
The planarity energy $E_{\mathrm{planar}}$ penalizes non-planar quadrilateral
faces. For each quad it can be defined either by the distance of the diagonals
(an idea attributed to Peter Schr\"oder in \cite{PottmannSBSWBW08}) or the
volume of the tetrahedron spanned by the
four vertices. We give the formula for the former here. 
\begin{equation}
E_{\mathrm{planar}} = \sum_{\mathrm{\it{ijkm}} \in F} \frac{\left<\Delta_{\mathrm{\it{ji}}},\Delta_{\mathrm{\it{mj}}} \times \Delta_{\mathrm{\it{ki}}}\right>^2}
{\Vert\Delta_{\mathrm{\it{mj}}} \times \Delta_{\mathrm{\it{ki}}}\Vert^2}
\end{equation}
Here $\Delta_{ij}$ is the vector pointing from vertex $i$ to $j$.

For $E_{\mathrm{incircle}}$ we use the energy defined by
\cite{schiftner-2009-cp} based on the fact that the sum of opposite edge
lengths must be equal for a planar quad to possess an incircle.
\begin{equation}
E_{\mathrm{incircle}} = \sum_{\mathrm{\it{ijkm}} \in F} \left( l_{\mathrm{\it{ij}}} + 
l_{\mathrm{\it{km}}} - l_{\mathrm{\it{jk}}} - l_{\mathrm{\it{mi}}} \right)^2
\end{equation}
The energy
$E_{\mathrm{touch}}$ is a new energy that enforces touching incircles
if faces are planar and possess incircles.  It is defined per edge, see
Figure~\ref{fig:functional} for the exact labeling of the angles at one edge.
For an interior edge $ij\in E$ we define
\begin{equation}
  E_{\mathrm{touch}}(\mathrm{\it{ij}})=
  \left(\cot\frac{\beta^j_l}{2}\cot\frac{\beta^i_r}{2} - 
\cot\frac{\beta^j_r}{2}\cot\frac{\beta^i_l}{2}\right)^2.
\end{equation}
On boundary edges the energy is zero. All energies can be formulated 
in terms of the vertex coordinates and the derivatives can be calculated explicitly.



Since all energies are in general non-convex we need a good initial guess to 
find meaningful minimizers of $E_S$.
S-isothermic minimal surfaces converge to isothermic parameterizations of
smooth minimal surfaces~\cite{BobHofSpr06}. For general S-isothermic surfaces
this is an open conjecture. The parameterizations obtained in
Section~\ref{sec:parametrization} are good candidates to start from with the
optimization of the functional.
%numerics
We use the non-linear optimization package PETSc/TAO~\cite{petsc-web-page,
tao-user-ref} and its java binding~\cite{jpetsctao-web-page} to find
minimizers of $E_S$. Figure~\ref{fig:convergence} shows convergence plots of
$E_S$ for the four models that were discussed in the previous section.
\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{../images/dach_example01_circles.png}
\caption{The S-isothermic circle packing on the \textsc{Roof} model in detail.}
\end{figure}

As seen in the quality analysis of Section~\ref{sub:examples_quality}, the
\textsc{Teaser}, the \textsc{Minimal}, and the \textsc{Roof} models are
quasiisothermic surfaces with low modulus. For these models the corresponding S-isothermic
surface is also close to the input surface. Figure~\ref{fig:convergence} shows
the energy during the optimization. Here the three close-to-isothermic meshes
start with a lower energy than the \textsc{Dome} model. After the \textsc{Dome}
has passed some iterations it exhibits convergence properties similar to the
other models. As this surface converges against a discrete S-isothermic surface,
we observe a considerable change in shape during the first iterations
especially around the singularities.

\begin{figure}[tb]

\caption{Convergence behavior of $E_S$ during optimization. We use the meshes 
displayed in Figure~\ref{fig:all_mesh} as initial guesses for the minimization. The
convergence of the Teaser geometry is slower due to the high complexity.}
\label{fig:convergence}
\end{figure}

%Concluding we emphasize that the shapes obtained by optimization of the
%functional are S-isothermic by definition. We have demonstrated for the
%\textbf{Dome} shape how this method can approximate non-isothermic surfaces by
%nearby S-isothermic meshes.

%\subsection{Isometric Deformations of Minimal Surfaces}
%\label{sub:isometric}

%deformed surfaces with 
%period $2\pi$. The histogram shows the edge length error of the $90^\circ$ model
%when compared 
%with the initial surface. The mean edge length deviation of this model is $1.28\%$.}
%	\label{fig:isometric} 
%\end{figure*}
%
%Every smooth minimal surface possesses a $1$-parameter (associated) family of
%non-trivial isometric deformations. All surfaces in this family have the same
%Gau{\ss} map. For discrete S-isothermic minimal surfaces this construction is
%discretized in~\cite{BobHofSpr06}: Edge lengths and the conformality of the
%parameterization are preserved. We need to introduce the concept of dual surface
%to construct the family of isometric surfaces.
%
%\noindent\textbf{The Dual Surface.}
%In differential geometry for isothermic surfaces there is a notion of a dual
%surface. This dual or Christoffel transform is also an isothermic surface. Both
%surfaces are parameterized with isothermic coordinates. This setup can be
%discretized using the definition of discrete S-isothermic surfaces. The dual
%surface can be constructed using the incircle structure of S-isothermic meshes.
%We introduce consistent signs on edges on a discrete S-isothermic surface such
%that opposite sides of the quads have the same sign and consecutive edges in a
%quad have different signs. The dual mesh of a mesh $M$ will have parallel edges
%calculated as follows: Let $e_{ij}=v_j-v_i$ be an edge vector of~$M$. Then the
%dual edge vector $e_{ij}^*$ satisfies the following equation:
%\[e_{ij}^* = \pm \frac{1}{r_i \cdot r_j} e_{ij}\]
%where $r_i$ and $r_j$ are the distances from the vertex $v_i$ and $v_j$ to the
%touching point of the incircles of incident faces at the edge~$e_{ij}$. For a
%given
%discrete S-isothermic mesh we can easily calculate the dual mesh by enumerating
%the vertices along a spanning tree of edges. In Figure~\ref{fig:isometric} the
%dual surface of the \textbf{Minimal} model is shown in the upper left hand
%corner.  Via the dual surface we can now construct isometric deformations of
%minimal surfaces.
%
%\noindent\textbf{Deformation.}
%The dual of a smooth minimal surface coincides with its Gau{\ss} map which is a
%part of a sphere. This sphere may be multiply covered. For discrete S-isothermic
%minimal surfaces this Gau{\ss} map is a part of a Koebe polyhedron, i.e., a
%polyhedral surfaces with edges tangent to a sphere. On the Koebe polyhedron
%every edge is rotated by a fixed angle in the tangent space of the sphere at the
%points of tangency of the edge. The resulting edge vectors again form closed
%quads and can be dualized. This dual surface has the same edge lengths as the
%initial minimal surface.
%
%For minimal quad meshes with touching incircles that were created using our
%parameterization and the optimization step, the dual surface will be close to a
%Koebe polyhedron. We use a least-squares-sphere to define a consistent tangent
%space at the touching points of incircles with the edges. The resulting
%deformation of a given minimal surface is then close to isometric. To distribute
%the isometry error on the edges we average over different roots of the layout
%spanning tree. Surfaces that do not possess exact isometric deformations are
%deformed approximative.
%
%We apply this procedure to the \textbf{Minimal} model
%\mbox{(Figure~\ref{fig:all_mesh}a)}. Figure~\ref{fig:isometric} shows the
%surface together
%with its dual and isometrically deformed versions with different turning angles.

\section{Conclusions and Future Research}
\label{sec:future}
%XXX: should we mention quasiisothermic parameterizations?
The main contributions of this article are, on the one hand, the definition of 
quasiisothermic parameterizations together with a new algorithm to
compute parameterizations of surfaces that optimizes the corresponding quality measure.
On the other hand, we have defined a new energy for meshes with touching incircles.

%Previous approaches to the problem of curvature line parameterization have been
%proposed by many authors: \cite{KalbererNP:QuadCover07} are able to produce high quality
%parameterizations for general frame fields on triangulated surfaces of
%arbitrary genus. \cite{zadravec-2010-vf} are also
%motivated by applications to architecture and optimize the structure of the
%mesh using conjugate directions and a level set method for remeshing.

\newpage
We see the main advantage of the algorithm presented in
Section~\ref{sec:parametrization} in its simplicity and its applicability to
shell-like roof structures which arise in architectural models. Since these
models often have almost constant mean curvature and thus allow for an almost
isothermic parameterization, our algorithm performs particularly well on these
examples.

%We use fixed boundary conditions during parameterization, thus the quality
%of the meshes in terms of the quality functional can be improved. This leads
%to a control problem where the boundary angles become variables in an
%optimization step. We are in the process of investigating this control
%problem. Our current approach yields good approximations to the real minimizers
%of the functional and in case of isothermic surfaces they coincide. One could
%also propose different quality functionals that take into account that the
%curvature directions are unstable in the vicinity of nearly umbilic regions. 

The new energy described in Section~\ref{sec:s-isothermic} is closely related
to the article of \cite{schiftner-2009-cp} dealing with
circle packing meshes. They explicitly do not treat quadrilateral meshes since
they are aware of the shape restrictions and focus on triangle meshes instead.
The shape restriction lies in the core of isothermic surfaces but
did not influence our results dramatically for the surfaces in our focus. How
to approximate arbitrary surfaces by isothermic surfaces is unknown and will be
subject to future research. The results of Section~\ref{sec:s-isothermic}
suggest that this might be possible using related methods.

Our new functional generates quad circle packing meshes in the sense of
Schiftner \emph{et al.}. For surfaces arising in architectural context (in
particular for shell-like roofs) we are able to construct aesthetically
pleasing quad meshes supporting a circle packing. 
%This additional structure may be used
%to deform the surface if it is close to a minimal surface. We know from the
%smooth theory that such deformations are also possible for general constant
%meancurvature surfaces but this has not been discretized, yet. For
%non-isothermic
%surfaces we were also able to construct nearby planar quad circle packing
%surfaces.

%The study of different mesh types has recently been a very active field of
%research in discrete differential geometry. It would be interesting to see
%further connections between the considered meshes in mathematics and
%applications in computer graphics and geometry processing. Also deformations of
%special mesh classes would be interesting for modelling or for constructing
%mobile structures in architecture.
