	How to create a regular hex mesh with VaryLab

1.  Nurbs Manager
      import pin_doublycurved_nurbs.obj u 200 v 20
1.1 Press the e key to encompass the geometry

2.  Topology->Identify Vertices
	use a distance of 0.1

3.  Discrete Conformal Parametrization
      x Expert Mode
      Target Geometry	Euclidean
      Boundary		Conformal, Straight
      ->Unwrap

4.  Select Vertex for orthogonal cut at head of pin
	->Discrete Conformal->Visualization->Cut along line
	Select the newly created layer and disable the old one
	both are called Default Layer (we have to fix that)

5.  ContentAppearance 
      Select triangle/hex pattern preview
      Texture Scale u 35.025 v 60.605

6.  Surface Remeshing
      Pattern	Boundary Aligned Triangles
      -> Remesh

7.  Topology->Identify Vertices
      Distance 0.3 (29 pairs found)

8.  Create new layer pin_doublycurved_nurbs.obj in
      load surface into the layer as above
      reselect the mesh layer

9.  NURBS->Project to Nurbs Surface 
      Select newly created Layer with Nurbs Surface from 8.

10. Remove the cut:
      1. Select an edge 
      2. Selection->Geodesic
      3. Editing->Remove edge and fill
      4. Texture Remeshing->Collapse 1,2-valent vertices

11. Create hex mesh
      1. Select Vertex inside a hexagon to be removed
      2. Selection->Lattice
      3. Editing->Remove vertex and fill

12. Topology Explode

13. Planarize Polygons
      1. Optimizer Plugins
      	 x Planar N-Gons
      2. Optimization
      	 No Constraints
	 100 Iterations, CG

14. Regularize hexagons
      1. Optimizer Plugins
      	 x Regular n-gons
	 x Spring Energy
	     const. length 1.65, Strength 1 
	     (maybe measure edge lengths first with an edge length histogram)
