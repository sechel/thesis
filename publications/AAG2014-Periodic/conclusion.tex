\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

%\begin{itemize}
%\item Torsion free support structure via panel plane intersection.
%\item More elaborate discretization of lengths
%\end{itemize}

We presented a method for homogeneous periodic panelization of \nurbs
surface geometry of cylinder type.  A natural future development is
the design of suitable support structures possibly with torsion free
nodes. This can be derived from the panel layout by intersecting the
panel planes. Furthermore the quantization of edge lengths of regular
hexagonal panels is not yet fully explored. A denser distribution of
quantized edge lengths in regions with great edge length variance can
possibly improve the layout and number of different panels.
