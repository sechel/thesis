\section{Conclusion}

A non-linear variational method for optimising topologies of regular and irregular elastic gridshells is presented in this paper. The design parameters {\it mesh size}, {\it reference surface} and {\it profiles curvature} are defined as penalising energies with corresponding weighting factors. The resulting grid configuration is calculated by a non-linear algorithm by minimizing the linear combination of these three energies. The advantage of the variational method compared to other existing ones is that spacing between grid and target surface can be allowed and displacements of the grid nodes are possible in all directions, thus a further optimisation of the grid topology can be achieved. Moreover, by defining different priorities between the design parameters through the energy weighting factors, diverse grid configurations can be generated and the resulting gridshell design can be adapted to specific structural and architectural requirements.
