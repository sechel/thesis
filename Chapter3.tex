In the field of Discrete Differential Geometry (DDG) there is a special need for experiments
conducted with the help of computer software. Especially if the methods of DDG are applied
to problems in computer graphics, geometry processing, or architecture, algorithms have 
to be implemented and convincing examples have to be presented. Additionally a suitable 
visualization of the results has to be included in a state-of-the-art publication.

There is a growing knowledge of software development in the mathematical community. This 
is partly due to the curricula of universities which started to include programming courses for 
undergraduate students. This enables the students to extend their abilities of creating 
visualizations and mathematical software, where former generations of students solely 
used Mathematica and MatLab.

This Chapter is the description and getting-started manual of a set of software packages
(DDG Framework) written in Java. They are specifically designed for the creation of
custom interactive software for experiments with algorithms and geometries treated 
within DDG. Section~\ref{sec:jrworkspace} introduces the {\sc JRworkspace} library of the 
{\sc Jtem} project~\cite{JtemWebsite}. It is the foundation of any application created with 
the DDG Framework. It is also the user interface basis of {\sc Jreality}, a mathematical 
visualization library that uses {\sc JRworkspace} as plug-in and user interface 
tool~\cite{JrealityWebsite}. Section~\ref{sec:halfedge_halfedgetools} introduces the 
{\sc Halfedge} and {\sc HalfedgeTools} package. It implements a half-edge data 
structure and various user interface tools and algorithms for interaction and editing.  
In Section~\ref{sec:conformallab} we describe the software 
{\sc ConformalLab}. This package implements the methods of the 
publications~\cite{Bobenko2010, OWR2012, Sechelmann2012, BobSechSpr}.
Section~\ref{sec:varylab} introduces {\sc VaryLab} the software implementation of the 
methods described in the publications \cite{Lafuente2011, Lafuente2012, Sechelmann2012}.
This package is also released to partners of the development group as 
{\sc VaryLab[Gridshells]}, {\sc VaryLab[Ultimate]}, or even online as {\sc VaryLab[Service]}.



Figure~\ref{fig:software_architecture} shows the dependencies of the packages. Every
application depends on {\sc JRworkspace} which implements plug-in functionality. It is
the basis of the {\sc Jreality} plug-in system. {\sc Half\-edge\-Tools} is using {\sc Jreality} 
for visualization and is build on top of the {\sc Jtem} project {\sc Half\-edge}. 
{\sc ConformalLab} and {\sc VaryLab} use {\sc Jpetsc/Jtao} to perform numerical
optimization. Their algorithms are implemented as {\sc JRworkspace} plug-ins.


The development of the described software is joint work with Thilo R{\" o}rig 
({\sc HalfedgeTools, VaryLab}), the {\sc Jreality} members~\cite{JrealityWebsite}, Hannes 
Sommer ({\sc Jpetsc/Jtao})~\cite{jpetsctao-web-page}, Paul Peters ({\sc JRworkspace}), and 
Boris Springborn ({\sc Halfedge}).
