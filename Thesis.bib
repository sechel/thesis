  pages = {326--337},
  abstract = {{We propose a new method to compute planar triangulations of faceted
	surfaces for surface parameterization. In contrast to previous approaches
	that define the flattening problem as a mapping of the three-dimensional
	node locations to the plane, our method defines the flattening problem
	as a constrained optimization problem in terms of angles (only).
	After applying a scaling that derives from the 'curvature' at a node,
	we minimize the relative deformation of the angles in the plane with
	respect to their counterparts in the three-dimensional surface. This
	approach makes the method more stable and robust than previous approaches,
	which used node locations in their formulations. The new method can
	handle any manifold surface for which a connected, valid, two-dimensional
	parameterization exists, including surfaces with large curvature
	gradients. It does not require the boundary of the flat two-dimensional
	domain to be prede-fined or convex. We use only the necessary and
	sufficient constraints for a valid two-dimensional triangulation.
	As a result, the existence of a theoretical solution to the minimization
	procedure is guaranteed.}},
