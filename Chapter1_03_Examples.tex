\section{Branched coverings of $\Chat$}
In this section we discuss Riemann surfaces that arise as branched double coverings of $\hat{\C}$. A Riemann surface that can be represented as a double cover of $\Chat$ is called elliptic for $g=1$ and hyperelliptic for $g>1$~\cite[p.~235]{Jost2007}. Such a double cover of $\Chat$ can be described by the
set of solutions of an algebraic equation.

\begin{definition}
Let $\lambda_1,\ldots,\lambda_{2g+2}\in \hat{\C}$, $\lambda_i\neq \lambda_j \forall i\neq j$. The
set

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:branched_cover}
C=\{(z, \mu)\in\C^2 \mid \mu^2 = \prod_{i=1}^{2g+2}(z-\lambda_i)\}
\end{equation}

is called an \emph{algebraic curve of genus $g$}.
\end{definition}

$C$ is a one dimensional complex manifold. The projection $\pi:C\to\Chat$, $C\ni(z,\mu)\mapsto z$ is a branched double cover of $\Chat$. The points $\lambda_1,\ldots,\lambda_{2g+2}\in \hat{\C}$ are called
the branch points of $C$.

In order to discretize this construction and uniformize the corresponding discrete Riemann surfaces
we need a notion of discrete double cover of $\Chat$.

\begin{definition}
Let $C$ be an algebraic curve of genus $g$. Let $V = \{\lambda_1,\ldots,\lambda_{2g+2}\}$ be the set of
branch points of $C$. A triangulation of $\pi(C)$ with vertices $V$ is called a discrete double cover of 
$\Chat$.
\end{definition}

Note that by stereographic projection the triangle mesh of the discrete Riemann sphere is projected to a
discretely conformally equivalent triangle mesh, see Theorem~\ref{thm:moebius_invariance}.

\begin{definition}
Let $S$ be a discrete surface without boundary and vertices $v_1,\ldots,v_n\in\S^2$. $S$ is a \emph{discrete double branched cover} if there exist $i_1,\ldots, i_{2g+2}\in \N$ such that ... \marginpar{complete definition}
Let $\Chat_V$ be the discrete Riemann sphere with vertex set $V\subset S^2$. Let $v_1,
\ldots,v_{2g+2} \in V$ for $g\in \N$. A \emph{discrete double cover} of $\Chat_V$ 
\end{definition}

A discrete branched cover of $\Chat$ is a triangulation of $\pi(C)$ with vertices at $\lambda_i$.


\subsection{Elliptic curves}

Let $C$ be an elliptic algebraic curve and $R$ the corresponding Riemann surface. Let $\lambda_1, \ldots, \lambda_4 \in \Chat$ be the branch points of $C$. 

\begin{example}
\label{ex:wente_elliptic}
An example of a discrete elliptic curve is given by the equation
\begin{equation}
	\mu^2=z(z^3-1).
\end{equation}
This surface is also known as the Wente torus. Its modulus is $\tau=\sin(\frac{\pi}{3})i$. On the Riemann sphere
we can normalize the brach points to form a regular tetrahedron. The conformal structure is equivalent to that of 
the polygonal branched tetrahedron as its structure is flat by definition see Figure~\ref{fig:wente_elliptic}.
\end{example}

\subsection{Construction of hyperelliptic surfaces}

\begin{definition}
	A Rielmann surface is called \emph{hyperelliptic} if it admits a two-sheeted holomorphic map to
$\Chat$.
\end{definition}

Any hyperelliptic Riemann surface can be expressed as an algebraic curve of the form
\[ w^2 = \prod_{i=1}^{2g+2}(z-\lambda_i) \quad\quad g\geq1,\quad \lambda_i\neq \lambda_j \forall i\neq j.\]
Here $\lambda_i$ are the branch points of the doubly covered Riemann sphere.

\begin{example}
The surface 
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:regular_hyperelliptic}
	\mu^2=z(z^6-1)
\end{equation} 
is a genus $3$ surface with $6$ branch points at the 
roots of unity and at zero and at infinity. This surface admits a regular fundamental polygon.
The cuts on the surface to create a regular polygon are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:regular_branchdata}.
\end{example}

a regular fundamental polygon (red) with opposite sides identified. In this normalization
the axes of the identification motions meet in a point.}
\label{fig:regular_cover}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Weierstrass points on hyperelliptic surfaces}
A hyperelliptic surface comes together with a holomorphic involution $h$ called the hyperelliptic involution. The branch points are fixed points under this transformation. For a hyperelliptic algebraic curve it is $h(\mu, \lambda)=(-\mu, \lambda)$

\end{figure}

In this section we show how to use the discrete theory to calculate a Fuchsian uniformization of a Riemann surface 
given by Schottky data. For a triangulated fundametal domain of a Schottky group we show how to obtain a discretely
conformally equivalent triangulation either in the unit disk for genus greater that $1$ or in $\C$, see Figure~\ref{fig:fuchsian_to_schottky_genus2}. These triangulations build
a fundamental domain for the corresponding uniformizing Fuchsian or translation group of the given Riemann surface. We only consider classical Schottky groups here.

Let $C_1,C'_1\ldots,C_g,C'_g$ be disjoint circles in $\hat{\C}$. 
\begin{definition}
A classical Schottky group $G$ is a Kleinian group
with generators $\sigma_1,\ldots,\sigma_g$ satisfying
\[\frac{\sigma_i z - B_i}{\sigma_i z - A_i} = \mu_i \frac{z - B_i}{z - A_i}, \quad\quad\quad 0 < \left|\mu_i\right|<1,\]
where $\sigma_i$ maps the exterior of $C_i$ onto the interior of $C'_i$. The points $A_i$ and $B_i$ lie inside the circles $C_i$ and $C'_i$ respectively \cite{bobenko2011riemann}. 
\end{definition}
Figure~\ref{fig:schottky_group} illustrates this construction.
The quotient space $\Chat/G$ is a Riemann surface of genus $g$. The group $G$ is called the uniformizing
Schottky group. The points $A_i,\ldots,A_g$ and $B_i,\ldots,B_g$ are fixed points of this map.
A generator $\sigma$ with parameters $A$, $B$ and $\mu$ is a loxodromic transformation with matrix representation 
\[
\sigma = \frac{1}{A-B}
\begin{pmatrix}
	A\sqrt{\mu}-\frac{B}{\sqrt\mu} & AB\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt\mu}-\sqrt{\mu}\right) \\
	\sqrt\mu-\frac{1}{\sqrt\mu} & \frac{A}{\sqrt\mu}-B\sqrt\mu
\end{pmatrix}.
\]

any of the circles. The parameters $A$ and $B$ lie inside the cirlces by definition.}

\end{figure}



\subsection{Discretization}
Given a Riemann surface of genus $g$ and a classical Schottky uniformization, we calculate a corresponding 
Fuchsian uniformization using discrete conformal equivalence of spherical and hyperbolic triangle meshes.
A fundamental domain of the Schottky uniformization is the Riemann sphere without the interior of the circles.
We start with a classical Schottky group $G$. Let $\sigma_1,\ldots,\sigma_g$ be the generators of $G$. We choose circles around the fixed points of the

The triangulation of a fundamental domain has to respect the mappings between the circles. Vertices on identified 
circles have to be identified as well. It is however not clear a priori what the conformal structure of a triagulated 
fundamental domain is. The edge length on identified circles differ since there is a M{\" o}bius transformation 
between them. 

The idea to define the conformal structure is to use length cross-ratios instead of edge lengths. Both definitions are equivalent and define the conformal structure of a discrete Riemann surface. So given length cross ratios on edges we can calculate representative edge lengths in the discrete conformal class of the surface and, more obvious, vice versa. On boundary edges of the fundamental domain the length cross ratios agree since length-cross ratios are M{\" o}bius invariant.
